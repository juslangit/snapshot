"""Builds docs/index.html: the whole record of Snapshot in one file.

Every game of Luqman's keeps one living HTML record - the idea, the planning,
every decision and method, the session logs, and the screenshots with their
explanations - held in the repo and read as a website. This is the generator:
the project notes stay the source of truth and the page is rebuilt from them.

    python3 tools/docs/build_docs.py
    python3 tools/docs/build_docs.py --publish                # and rebuild the local records site

SITE: ~/Desktop/project/web/portfolio/records/snapshot/index.html
`docs-site` gathers every record in there, and the portfolio repo publishes the
folder on GitHub Pages: https://juslangit.github.io/Portfolio/records/snapshot/

The machinery here - the markdown converter, the image embedding, the page
template - was ported from direct-hit's build_docs.py, which took it from
referee-for-fun's. Only the data tables below are this game's own.

Reads:
    ~/.claude/knowledge/projects/snapshot/*.md and log/*.md   (override: KNOWLEDGE=...)
    dev/shots/*.png                                          (the galleries below)
    dev/checks/*.gd, dev/looks/*.gd                           (their ## headers)
    git log

Writes docs/index.html, fully self-contained: every screenshot is embedded as a
JPEG. No packages beyond the standard library; `sips`, built into macOS, does
the shrinking.

The screenshots are git-ignored, so take them first:

    /Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot --path . \
